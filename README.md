#Online Game Store

This is a sample README file for an online game store application built using Spring Boot, AspectJ, and Spring Security.
Introduction

The Online Game Store is a web application that allows users to browse and purchase a wide range of games. It provides a user-friendly interface for searching games, adding them to the shopping cart, and completing the checkout process. The application also ensures secure user authentication and authorization using Spring Security.
Technologies Used

##The application is built using the following technologies:

    Java
    Spring Boot
    AspectJ
    Spring Security
    Thymeleaf (for server-side templating)
    MySQL (for data storage)
    Hibernate (for object-relational mapping)
    HTML/CSS/JavaScript (for the frontend)

##Getting Started

To run the Online Game Store locally, follow these steps:

    Clone the repository from GitHub: git clone <repository_url>
    Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse).
    Configure the MySQL database by updating the application.properties file with your database credentials.
    Build the project using Maven or Gradle.
    Run the application from the main class.
    Access the application in your browser at http://localhost:8080.

##Features

The Online Game Store offers the following features:

    User Registration and Authentication: Users can create an account, log in, and log out of the application. Spring Security ensures secure authentication and manages user sessions.
    Game Catalog: Users can browse a catalog of available games, view details, and add them to the shopping cart.
    Shopping Cart: Users can add and remove games from their shopping cart, view the total price, and proceed to checkout.
    Checkout Process: Users can enter their shipping information, select a payment method, and complete the purchase.
    Order History: Users can view their past orders and track their delivery status.

##AspectJ Integration

AspectJ is used in the Online Game Store to implement cross-cutting concerns, such as logging, error handling, and performance monitoring. AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming) allows for cleaner code separation and promotes modularity.

The AspectJ aspects in this project are used to:

    Log method invocations and their parameters.
    Handle exceptions and provide appropriate error responses.
    Measure method execution time for performance monitoring.

##Project Structure

The project structure follows a typical Spring Boot application layout, with additional AspectJ-related files and packages:

    src/main/java: Contains the Java source code.
        com.example.gamestore: Main package for the application.
            config: Configuration classes for Spring Boot.
            controllers: Controllers for handling HTTP requests.
            models: Entity classes representing database tables.
            repositories: Interfaces for interacting with the database.
            services: Business logic and service classes.
            aspects: Aspect classes for cross-cutting concerns.
    src/main/resources: Contains configuration files and static resources.
        static: CSS and JavaScript files for the frontend.
        templates: Thymeleaf templates for server-side rendering.
        application.properties: Configuration properties for the application.
